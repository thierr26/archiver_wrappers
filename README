GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------

This repository contains shell scripts that can be used to create archive
files, list the content of archive files and extract archive files.  They
basically issue tar and zip / unzip commands, with the "right" flags (options)
selected automatically.  People (like me!) who have trouble remembering tar
syntax may find those scripts useful.

The scripts are named archive, list_archive and extract_archive.  You can have
them print their documentation by calling them with the --help option.

Please read the documentations below for details.

The scripts have been validated on a Debian GNU/Linux system, with dash as
/bin/sh.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SCRIPT archive
--------------------------------

Usage:

    archive DIR_TO_BE_ARCHIVED

    archive DIR_TO_BE_ARCHIVED DEST_DIR

    archive DIR_TO_BE_ARCHIVED PATH_TO_ARCHIVE_WITH_EXTENSION

    archive -h|--help

Description:

    Archive an entire directory (including its subdirectories).

    The first argument is the path (relative or absolute) to the directory
    to be archived.

    If no other argument is provided, then the archive is created in the
    working directory using a "tar -czvf" command.  The name of the archive
    is the base name of the directory given as first argument.  The extension
    of the archive is ".tgz".

    If the path (relative or absolute) to a directory is provided as
    second argument, then the archive is created in this directory using a
    "tar -czvf" command.  The name of the archive is the base name of the
    directory given as first argument.  The extension of the archive is
    ".tgz".

    If the path (relative or absolute) to the archive file is provided as
    second argument, then the command used to create the archive is selected
    based on the extension of the archive file:

        - A ".tar" extension causes a "tar -cvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.gz" extension causes a "tar -czvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tgz" extension causes a "tar -czvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.Z" extension causes a "tar -cZvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.bz2" extension causes a "tar -cjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tbz2" extension causes a "tar -cjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzma" extension causes a "tar -c --lzma -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tlz" extension causes a "tar -c --lzma -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.xz" extension causes a "tar -c --xz -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzo" extension causes a "tar -c --lzop -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tar.lzip" extension causes a "tar -c --lzip -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".zip" extension causes a "zip -rv" command to be used.

    In the archive, files have a path relative to the parent directory of
    the directory to be archived.

    archive does not check that the needed archiver and compressor programs
    are actually installed on the system before attempting to create the
    archive.  Thus, the command issued to create the archive may fail.

Options:

    -h, --help
        Display this documentation and exit.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SCRIPT list_archive
-------------------------------------

Usage:

    list_archive ARCHIVE_FILE

    list_archive -h|--help

Description:

    List the content of an archive file.

    The argument is the path to the archive file.

    The command used to list the content of the archive file depends on the
    extension of the file:

        - A ".tar" extension causes a "tar -tvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.gz" extension causes a "tar -tzvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tgz" extension causes a "tar -tzvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.Z" extension causes a "tar -tZvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.bz2" extension causes a "tar -tjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tbz2" extension causes a "tar -tjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzma" extension causes a "tar -t --lzma -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tlz" extension causes a "tar -t --lzma -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.xz" extension causes a "tar -t --xz -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzo" extension causes a "tar -t --lzop -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tar.lzip" extension causes a "tar -t --lzip -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".zip" extension causes an "unzip -lv" command to be used.

    list_archive does not check that the needed archiver and decompressor
    programs are actually installed on the system before attempting to list
    the content of the archive file.  Thus, the command issued to list the
    content of the archive file may fail.

Options:

    -h, --help
        Display this documentation and exit.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SCRIPT extract_archive
----------------------------------------

Usage:

    extract_archive ARCHIVE_FILE [DESTINATION]

    extract_archive -h|--help

Description:

    Extract an archive file.

    The first argument is the path to the archive file.  If no other argument
    is provided, then the archive file is extracted to the current working
    directory.

    The command used to extract an archive file depends on the extension of
    the file:

        - A ".tar" extension causes a "tar -xvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.gz" extension causes a "tar -xzvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tgz" extension causes a "tar -xzvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.Z" extension causes a "tar -xZvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.bz2" extension causes a "tar -xjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tbz2" extension causes a "tar -xjvf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzma" extension causes a "tar -x --lzma -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tlz" extension causes a "tar -x --lzma -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.xz" extension causes a "tar -x --xz -vf" command to be used.

        - A ".tar.lzo" extension causes a "tar -x --lzop -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".tar.lzip" extension causes a "tar -x --lzip -vf" command to
        be used.

        - A ".zip" extension causes an "unzip" command to be used.

    extract_archive does not check that the needed archiver and decompressor
    programs are actually installed on the system before attempting to extract
    the archive file.  Thus, the command issued to list the content of the
    archive file may fail.

Options:

    -h, --help
